# Enhancements to Datum Cloud

**Welcome!** This repository is dedicated to **major enhancements** that shape
the future of our platform. We’re thrilled to collaborate with you to make
meaningful improvements that benefit everyone in our community.

## What Belongs Here

- **Significant Architectural Changes**: Proposals that affect multiple services
  or involve large-scale adjustments.
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Security, performance, or interoperability
  improvements that impact multiple areas.
- **Long-Term Roadmap Items**: Features that span multiple releases or need
  extensive design work.

If your idea doesn’t fall under these categories (like minor fixes or small
feature requests), please submit it directly to the relevant project’s
repository. If you're not sure where it should go, ask us on our [community
slack](https://slack.datum.net/)!

## How to Propose an Enhancement

1. **Open a New Issue**
   - Head to the [Issues](https://github.com/datum-cloud/enhancements/issues)
     section.
   - Select **New Issue**, then describe your idea as clearly as possible.
2. **Provide Details**
   - Include background, visuals, or references to help everyone understand your
     proposal.
3. **Discuss & Refine**
   - Collaborate with maintainers and community members to refine details of the
     enhancement
   - Formalize an [enhancement document](./enhancements/template) in the
     relevant section of the repo. The location of the document can be decided
     in the issue tracking the enhancement.

## Tracking Progress

- We use a [GitHub Project][github-project] to show the **roadmap** of
  enhancements.
- Each proposal moves from `Backlog` to `In Progress` and finally `Completed`.
- Follow specific issues or pull requests to get notified about updates.
