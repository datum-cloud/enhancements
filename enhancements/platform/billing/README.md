# Milo's Billing Platform for Service Providers

## Overview

This document outlines the vision and proposed enhancements for the Milo
platform billing system. The billing platform aims to provide comprehensive
billing and financial management capabilities for B2B service providers. Using
declarative configuration principles, the proposed billing platform will enable
flexible monetization models, sophisticated cost tracking, and enterprise-grade
financial controls for organizations consuming services through the platform.

## Proposed Core Capabilities

### Billing Accounts (Provisional)

The foundation of the proposed billing system, billing accounts will serve as
the primary billing entity managing:

- **Payment Profiles**: Flexible payment methods and terms (Net30, Net60)
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Global operations with region-specific currency
  preferences
- **Project Linking**: Clear billing responsibility through
  project-to-billing-account associations with audit trail
- **Hierarchical Billing**: Support for billing sub-accounts in reseller and
  channel partner scenarios

### Commitment Management (Planned)

Proposed support for complex contractual arrangements including:
- **Minimum Spend Commitments**: Volume-based pricing with automated discount
  application
- **Flexible Reconciliation**: Monthly, quarterly, and yearly commitment periods
- **SKU-Level Discounts**: Percentage-based discounts applied to specific
  service SKUs
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into commitment utilization and
  remaining obligations

### Service Integration (Planned)

Planned deep integration with the platform's service catalog:
- **Entitlement Controls**: Service access and pricing governed by billing
  account entitlements
- **Usage Aggregation**: Automated collection and aggregation of service
  consumption metrics
- **Cost Allocation**: Precise tracking of resource usage across the
  organizational hierarchy
- **Invoice Generation**: Monthly invoicing with detailed usage breakdowns

### Budget Management & Alerts (Planned)

Budget controls and alerting capabilities spanning billing and telemetry:
- **Budget Definition**: Set spending limits at billing account and project
  levels
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Real-time tracking against defined budget limits
- **Alert Configuration**: Customizable alerts at various threshold levels (50%,
  75%, 90%, 100%)
- **Integration Points**:
  - Billing system owns budget definitions and threshold calculations
  - Telemetry system provides real-time usage data for budget tracking
  - Communication platform handles alert delivery via email, webhooks, and
    notifications
- **Forecasting**: Projected spend based on current usage patterns
- **Cost Anomaly Detection**: Automatic alerts for unusual spending patterns

## Proposed Architecture Principles

### Resource Model

Billing resources will follow declarative patterns:

- Organization-scoped billing accounts ensure proper isolation
- Immutable project links for comprehensive audit trails
- Declarative configuration for all billing entities
- Status tracking for operational visibility

### Security & Compliance

- RBAC-based access controls via IAM system
- Audit logging for all billing operations
- Encrypted storage of sensitive financial information
- Compliance-ready financial reporting

### Scalability Goals

- Design for high-volume transaction processing
- Efficient aggregation of usage across hundreds of thousands of projects
- Optimization for global, multi-region deployments
- Support for millions of billing events per month

## Target Use Cases

The billing platform aims to support the following scenarios:

### Enterprise Customers
